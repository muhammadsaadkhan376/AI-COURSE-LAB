        "\n",
        "* A* is a smart pathfinding algorithm used to find the **shortest path** in a weighted graph.\n",
        "* It uses two values:\n",

        "  * **g(n):** Actual cost to reach a node from the start.\n",
        "  * **h(n):** Estimated cost (heuristic) from that node to the goal.\n",
        "* It combines them:\n",

        "  f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",
